# 3D Scanning Dome Code

This project contains a couple of very simple programs for 3D Scanning. The first is a simple Arduino-based program for turning on LEDs and making them glow white.

The second is a set of old codes for basic 3D scanning and some new C++ code for controlling the Logitech C910 camera using UVC under Linux. The program uses CMake to run the build. It will accept XML files in the format created by the program GUVCView so one can load defaults for your particular device.
